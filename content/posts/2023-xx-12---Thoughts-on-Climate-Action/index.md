- I've been exclusively focused on climate action for the past three years
- Working on it, or aware of it, for the past 15
    - Early in my undergrad years I was sceptic, mostly due to my naivete regarding the scale of humanity's activity on Earth.
    - My attitude was "How could little old us affect something so *big*?"
    - Once I'd trespassed on a large mining operation on the outskirts of my hometown in Colorado. I'd seen the earth movers that had tires twice as tall as me. But I didn't really grasp just how that, multiplied by millions, contained within a closed system, could materially move the needle on a climactic scale.
    - My second major was Environmental Studies in my undergrad. The real a-ha moment was reading JR Petit's 1999 paper, [Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7rx4413n). How by comparing CO2 concentrations in air bubbles trapped in ice for hundreds of thousands of years with the proportions of different isotopes of water, shown to reflect climactic temperatures, we had observed the relationship between 
    - Suddenly I understood where the famous CO2 concentrations through history graph came from — a key part of the evidence basis for the greenhouse effect.

- Dad's background working at environmental clean-up facilities
    - Nuclear weapons production sites turned into multi-decade remediation projects
- Multi-dimensional set of crises — what Albert Wenger calls the "omnicrisis"
    - We each have our own value sets, and place different emphasis on different dimensions of the breakdown we're a part of
    - **This is a good thing.** We need people working on addressing the climate breakdown, mental health, addiction, erosion of our public discourse, exploitative business models of the attention economy, etc etc
- Personally, my focus has shifted around from fostering authentic human connection (Junctions) to a three year period exploring the world and showing others the natural and cultural beauty to addressing drivers of human conflict (OEF) to learning about spatial data technologies + Web3 to unlocking climate action at scale through digital innovation in impact finance.
- Each of these focal points were chosen due to combination of luck, interest, opportunity and work.
- The locus of control
- For whatever reason (I self-deprecatingly chalk it up to laziness), I'm drawn to activities I think will create the greatest positive impact for the least amount of work
- Why is creating positive impact a cardinal direction on my moral compass? I guess, why not? I can't think of a better reason to work
    - Of course, what is "positive"? And what is a reasonable sphere of influence? Providing for a happy and healthy life for a family someday, blah blah
    - Again, it's important to avoid hierarchical value judgments. I'm focused on what pressure I can exert on the system. Others should focus on the levers they have to hand. Otherwise we slip into an impact warrior arms race that leaves everyone burnt out
    - I expect I will write more on this, but for me, "positive" impact involves creating the conditions for life to flourish — for living beings + communities (including, but obviously not limited to, humans) to express our potential to the fullest extent possible. I'll acknowledge right here that this stance opens up a tricky can of tensions and interrelated considerations — life is complex — but it stands as an elevator pitch. What else are we here for? I plagiarize frequently from my friend Camilo, who said it most concisely: "Human dignity and planetary stewardship."
