Hello - I'm John. I am helping build a brighter future for humanity. 

My work is focused on how we can use emerging technologies to improve measures of planetary stewardship and human dignity. I'm an entrepreneur, researcher and community builder. 

Most recently, I've been focused on building tools to coordinate our response to the climate crisis as co-founder at [Toucan](https://toucan.earth). In the past I've dedicated effort to preventing human conflict, improving our understanding of the world using geospatial data, strengthening a community working to build a better Internet, teaching young technologists how to create thoughtfully, and helping people experience the world's natural and cultural beauty.

Currently I am taking a mini sabbatical (more on this soon).
