Hello - I'm John. I am helping build a brighter future for humanity. 

My work is focused on how we can use emerging technologies to improve measures of planetary stewardship and human dignity. I'm a data scientist, entrepreneur, researcher and community builder. I hold an MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualisation from UCL, where I graduated with distinction.

For the past five years I've been focused on building tools to coordinate our response to the climate crisis through my work as co-founder at [Toucan](https://toucan.earth), and more recently at [Astral](https://docs.astral.global/docs/introduction). In the past I've dedicated effort to preventing human conflict, improving our understanding of the world using geospatial data, strengthening a community working to build a better Internet, teaching young technologists how to create thoughtfully, and helping people experience the world's natural and cultural beauty.
